### ideas

* framework error (queue listener, background task error, custom scheduler trigger) forward to kafka?
* use adminClient to check kafka ready? or retry sending message?

* kafka: is static membership (group.instance.id) useful within stateful set?
  > static membership can avoid rebalance when pod restart

* db: update "on duplicated key" values() syntax,
  > The use of VALUES() to refer to the new row and columns is deprecated beginning with MySQL 8.0.20, and is subject to removal in a future version of MySQL.

* switch httpclient to jdk built in after jdk 24?, then send goaway frame in ShutdownHandler
  https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8335181

* log diagram, fix d3 tooltip (generate separated json, and make d3 tooltip show other non-HTML info)

* redis using ping/pong to validate connection? for zero downtime upgrading e.g. with gcloud memory store
* migrate to dragonflydb and support RESP3 (cluster / MOVED handling) ?

* migrate to opensearch ? or update ES to 9.x

* support hsql postgres dialect, to test postgres specific sql?

### obsoleted

* template, use ByteBuffer[] for performance? (server side template not useful anymore)
* impl own json bind by referring https://github.com/json-iterator/java and https://github.com/ngs-doo/dsl-json with annotation processor? (use RUST if performance is critical)
